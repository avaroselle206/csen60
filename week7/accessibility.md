- “The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.” – Tim Berners-Lee
- Accessibility helps your website’s SEO and not breaking the law

Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

Screen Readers
- Change the visual display into audio output
    - Scan a window and read things in the order they appear
    - Some take HTML structure into account
    - Useful for those with vision or literacy difficulties
- Braille displays
    - Provide output as Braille rather than audio
    - Useful if both blind and deaf
- Effects of these

- Uses
